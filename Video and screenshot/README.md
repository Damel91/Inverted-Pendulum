# Inverted-Pendulum
Some videos and screenshot(of the webpage seen from the phone) of the self balancing robot that I made, note that it doesn't have speed encoders, so it doesn't know where is it going but is very stable on a flat surface.

The remote controls works like a kick, so the robot wil start to go and then it will stop

Be carefull to the red button ;)

If you have any suggestion for the controls code it would be apreciate, the controls are managed into the websocket event
