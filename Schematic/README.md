# Inverted-Pendulum
Circuit presented as on breadboard for the Self balancing robot based on ESP8266

Note that this is not the real positioning of the components, it just need to let you and me in the future to understand the circuit, even the battery and the motor are just for "understand" infact I use a 2S LIPO by the husban h502e/s for my project, while the motors are n20 12V 200 or 300 rpm kind. 

If you are suign a breadboard I personally suggest you to supply with 5V the ESP8266 first. I also have got a lot of issues by using  prototyping cables that go fron the bread board to the hc-sr04, because when the servo is moving, the cables are stressed and they tend to break.
