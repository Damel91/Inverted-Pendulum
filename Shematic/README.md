# Inverted-Pendulum
Circuit presented as on breadboard for the Self balancing robot based on ESP8266

Note that this is not the real positioning of the components, it just need to let you and me in he future to understand the circuit, even the battery and the motor are just for "understand" infact I use a 2S LIPO by the husban h502e/s for my project, while the motors are n20 12V kind.
